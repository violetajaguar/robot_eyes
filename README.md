ROBOT EYES

Real-time pixel-poetry from a future version of yourself.

ROBOT EYES is a live computer-vision experiment where a pixelated, black-and-white version of you watches you back.
The system reads micro-movements of your eyes, generates strange cyberpunk thoughts, and speaks them with synthesized voice.
A dialogue loop between your present and future self.

Philosophy

This project imagines AI not as a tool but as a witness:

A small prototype of future cinema.
